In this project, we aim to convert Excel sheet data into a visually informative pie chart using Python. We will utilize libraries like openpyxl for handling Excel files and matplotlib.pyplot for chart creation. The process involves reading data from a specific Excel sheet, organizing it into suitable data structures, and then generating a pie chart that accurately represents the data's proportions. Customizations such as labels, colors, and chart formatting can be applied as needed. This project provides a practical solution for automating the creation of pie charts from Excel data, facilitating data visualization and analysis within Python programming environments.
